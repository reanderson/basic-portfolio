      About Me

    <p>
      I was born on June 17, 1994 in Morristown, New Jersey, and currently live in Bridgewater, New Jersey. I attended middle and
      high school at Rutgers Preparatory School in Somerset, New Jersey, before moving on to get my Bachelors of Arts in
      Japanese at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York.

      I love all animals, though I am primarily a cat person. I have had Siamese cats for my entire life. I adore their talkative
      nature! Right now, I have two Siamese kittens named Yuki and Suzu. They are from the same litter, and are about six
      months old.

      Most of my hobbies involve telling stories in some variety. I play video games, primarily RPGs, where I can get invested
      in the stories and characters. Additionally, I love to write my own stories to share with my friends. I have recently
      begun playing Dungeons and Dragons with some of my friends, inspired by online shows such as Critical Role, which I
      have found is a perfect combination of my love of experiencing other people's stories and creating my own.
